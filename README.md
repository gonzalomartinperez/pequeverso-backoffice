# pequeverso-backoffice

Private backoffice for Pequeverso. Its implemented capabilities are OAuth sign-in for the owner
and invited people, access management, and the shopping assistant's operations dashboard:
health, catalog freshness, runs, latency, tokens and spend. The public conversation lives only in the storefront
(`pequeverso`); the former chat shells were removed from this repository (see git history).

The repository is public; the application is private. Owner-authored software uses
the [MIT License](LICENSE); [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) reserves brand, content and data
and preserves third-party rights.

The repository was renamed to `pequeverso-backoffice` on 2026-10-17; earlier GitHub URLs
redirect, while local checkout paths and persistent identifiers remain unchanged. This name
does not claim a completed business analytics suite. An independently disabled site-activity
report consumes the API's bounded synthetic or production-class aggregates through a pinned
contract and existing IAM checks. Received events are not people, orders, revenue or conversion.
It adds no browser collector or production activation. Existing assistant
feedback may inform human review, deterministic fixtures/evaluations, a reviewed PR and a
release. It does not imply automatic model training or additional conversation storage.

Dependency triage is read-only and every merge remains manual after review and required checks;
updates, native rebases and security alerts stay active. An eligible assessment or label is not
merge authority. See [the dependency procedure](docs/dependencies.md).

**Runtime maintenance — 2026-10-17:** the selected cohort is Node24.22.0 LTS,
Next16.4.2, React/DOM19.3.1, Better Auth1.7.10 and Playwright1.64.1. The framework security
patch is already released at `29b293f` through [PR60](https://github.com/gonzalomartinperez/pequeverso-assistant-backoffice/pull/60);
this separate maintenance change keeps admission, roles, contracts and SQL migrations intact.
Read [the cohort review and verification limits](docs/verification/runtime-cohort-2026-10-17.md)
before choosing an image. Current-head protected CI determines acceptance; no deployment is implied.

**Historical dashboard release — 2026-10-13:** the compact availability and telemetry dashboard and maintained
distroless runtime were integrated into `main` at `f96d30d` through
[release PR #50](https://github.com/gonzalomartinperez/pequeverso-assistant-backoffice/pull/50).
[Release CI](https://github.com/gonzalomartinperez/pequeverso-assistant-backoffice/actions/runs/38384606345)
passed all seven jobs, including the exact CI image smoke and 51 browser tests across four
projects (three optional live-API tests skipped; no retries). Its runtime design uses Node24,
Debian13 and UID/GID65532; the maintenance pins above are separate from that historical evidence.
Earlier local failures and image drills remain dated history in
[verification](docs/verification.md). CI fixture evidence does not prove deployment,
real OAuth, TLS cookies, VPS capacity or provider billing. This project has not deployed the
backoffice, and the dashboard never enables the storefront.

## Local site-activity gallery — 2026-10-19

These native captures use the local production build, an isolated synthetic API/PostgreSQL/Neo4j
fixture and a fake OAuth provider. Received events are not people, orders, revenue or conversions.
The application reads the API from its server; browser views contain no private API bearer.
The disabled view makes no private report read. The enabled views select nine synthetic events:
two page views, three section views and four public clicks, with three visible clicks and one
withheld by the privacy threshold.

| Local fixture view | Native capture |
| --- | --- |
| Report disabled · desktop | ![Disabled local site-activity report](docs/verification/analytics-native-2026-10-19/off-desktop.png) |

[Exact source, capture manifest and verification limits](docs/verification/native-runtime2026-10-19.md).
This is a local fixture, not a VPS deployment, live production traffic, real Google/GitHub OAuth,
provider availability or model-quality evidence. Production configuration capability does not
activate collection or establish a trusted deployed edge. The historical availability gallery
below retains its original 2026-10-13 fixtures and provenance; these images do not recertify it.


## Rendered dashboard gallery

These are native-resolution screenshots of the actual local production build, captured at
2× device scale with desktop 1440×1000 and mobile 390×844 viewports. **Every image uses local
MOCK/fixture operations data and a fake OAuth provider.** They show the UI, not external OAuth,
a VPS deployment, production metrics, OpenAI availability or model quality. Unknown resource
values remain “No disponible”; reported token usage produces a calculated cost, not a
reconciled provider invoice. The historical daily budget is explicitly labelled with its day.
The synthetic API may report enabled; the storefront has its own assistant switch and stays
disabled in this release preparation.

Open each PNG for legible original pixels. Mobile overview/focus images show the first
viewport; daily/resource details show complete sections. Mobile table views disclose different
columns through actual horizontal scrolling. The [capture notes](docs/verification/compact-availability-2026-10-13/README.md)
record provenance and agent inspection; they do not claim human review.

## Source and build locations

Browser specifications live in `tests/browser`, with unit and PostgreSQL integrations in
`tests/unit` and `tests/integration`. Application and IAM fixture recipes use repository-root
build context and colocated context filters:

```sh
docker buildx build --load -f infra/docker/app/Dockerfile -t pequeverso-backoffice:reviewed .
docker buildx build --load -f infra/docker/postgres/Dockerfile -t pequeverso-backoffice-postgres:reviewed .
```

The second recipe is an owned local/CI artifact, not a second production database service.
Production targets one API-owned PostgreSQL 18.6 Alpine/pgvector engine and separate API/IAM databases.
No production Compose or deployment controller is introduced. See the
[architecture map](docs/architecture.md#container-and-browser-test-locations) and
[deployment contract](docs/deployment-contract.md).

Agent procedures use one canonical `.claude/skills` catalog and relative directory discovery
links in `.agents/skills`. See [skill maintenance and validation](docs/agent-skills.md).

No application dependency is added.

The private dashboard reads operational evidence through a bounded, validated server adapter.
Summary revision 1.2 and optional telemetry revision 1.0 come from the assistant API. Private
PostgreSQL stores operator identity, sessions and invitations; the API owns its catalog,
conversations and accounting behind the private operations contract. This backoffice serves no
chat and receives no conversation content, buyer data or provider keys. The storefront talks directly to the API only when its
assistant is separately enabled; publishable storefront builds currently keep it disabled.

Point-in-time process readings are not historical availability: no uptime percentage is invented
from a single observation, process uptime or successful scrape. Optional OTLP and private
Prometheus scraping complement Grafana and require vps-ops configuration and separate
authorization. These boundaries describe integration, not an existing deployment or validated
VPS capacity. On a narrow screen, use this prose and the full-size links alongside the diagram.

## Quick start (no real credentials)

```bash
nvm use && npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium firefox webkit
docker run -d --rm --name bo-pg -e POSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
  -p 127.0.0.1:55432:5432 postgres:18.6-trixie@sha256:885953109528ad3dfc90362b1a6f50a78620b5315be19f187753d267e484dc5b
npm run build
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres npm run preview:backoffice
```

Open http://localhost:3241/ingresar and choose "Proveedor de prueba": a local fake identity
provider signs you in as `owner@example.test`; the dashboard shows the **synthetic** fixture from
`scripts/mock-ops.ts`, clearly labelled. Its static numbers and startup-refreshed sample timestamps
are demonstration data, not live process measurements. To read a real API instead, run
`pequeverso-assistant-api` with `OPS_READ_TOKEN` set and start the stack with `LIVE_OPS_URL` and
`LIVE_OPS_TOKEN` (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

The official PostgreSQL image above is an isolated local test server, not the final hardened
artifact or a deployment recipe. The initialized `postgres` database exists and the
synthetic `test` administrator can create the disposable databases used by the suites.
No real credentials or remote database are permitted. Stop only this own server after use:
`docker stop bo-pg`. For the reviewed non-root/read-only artifact, use
[PostgreSQL runtime](docs/postgresql-runtime.md) and its exact-image SQL backup/restore drill.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run check` | Biome, TypeScript 7, unit/contract/boundary tests, file/docs/skills checks, build |

## Software license

Owner-authored software and technical documentation use the [MIT License](LICENSE).
Brand, product/commercial content, media, datasets, private data and third-party
material are excluded; see [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) and the preserved
[third-party attribution](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). The runtime carries all three
notices under `/app/`; the application's access controls and privacy obligations
are unchanged.

The independently disabled [site-activity report](docs/product-analytics.md) reads bounded
site-event aggregates behind the existing IAM guard, distinguishing synthetic fixtures from
production-class data. Country defaults to unknown; enabling configuration does not prove a
trusted deployed edge. It adds no visitor collector or production activation and keeps the
operational dashboard and its contracts separate.
