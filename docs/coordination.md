# Coordination record

Reference repositories are read-only. This file records what was inspected, at which revision, and
what was adopted. Inspections happen at milestones, not continuously.

## Milestone 1 — foundation (2026-09-27)

| Repository | Revision inspected | State | Adopted / decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pequeverso` (storefront) | `develop` `7ae5987` (clean) | Next 16 static/standalone, Tailwind 4, shadcn base-vega, TS 7.0.2, Spanish only, light theme, Hotmart checkout | Brand tokens, fonts, isotipo, copy tone ("tú", neutral LATAM), coral-for-purchase rule, "no invented claims" rule, verified origin `https://pequeverso.com`. TS config strictness flags. **No chat/assistant code exists** there: nothing to transfer. |
| `pequeverso-assistant-api` | `8428fce` (bootstrap) + uncommitted working tree | Domain, application, HTTP presentation and generated contracts present but **not committed** | Pinned snapshot of generated `contracts/` (see `api-contract.md` (removed; see git history)). Cookie name `__Host-pv_assistant`, CSRF in memory, single conversation per session, `page` context, product `url`/`purchase_url`/nullable `price`. |
| `portfolio-assistant-web` | `develop` `f460fc4` + uncommitted `feat/embedded-assistant` | Closure external-store controller, fetch-SSE reader, node:test, harness | Adopted: controller pattern (lifetime AbortController, single-flight generation, bounded cancel, no auto-regeneration), SSE bounds, exact-key protocol validation, first-origin pinning, per-origin `assistant.ready`, host harness idea, contract manifest check, skills layout. **Not adopted:** plain CSS modules (this repo uses Tailwind), react-markdown (the API promises plain text), multi-conversation UI, the `typescript` JS-API boundary checker (TS 7 has no JS API). |
| `portfolio` (site) | `main` `45d8a42` (clean) | Tailwind 4 + shadcn radix-nova, TS 7.0.2, `next typegen && tsc --noEmit` | `@theme inline` over semantic tokens, `cn()` + CVA primitives with `data-slot`, 44 px targets, canonical skills in `.agents/skills` with Claude adapters, Biome config shape. |
| `vps-ops` | `feat/pequeverso-planning` `74d4fa5` | Planning only: no domain, routes or services for Pequeverso yet | Same-origin `/api/*` routing, no prefix stripping, digest-pinned images, read-only root + tmpfs, header conflict raised in [deployment-contract.md](deployment-contract.md). |

## Mid-milestone re-inspection (2026-09-27 17:08 UTC)

The API working tree gained `app/presentation/*` and generated `contracts/` after the first read;
routes were unchanged, `http.py` hash changed. The snapshot was re-taken from the generated
artifacts (manifest `d163b6d7…`). The storefront and vps-ops were unchanged.

## Milestone 2 — before the first release (2026-09-27 20:05 UTC)

| Repository | Revision | Change since milestone 1 | Adopted / decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pequeverso-assistant-api` | `develop` `dc4e4c6` (released to its `main` `207a61f`); clean tree | Everything committed; contract v1 introduced in `0750524`; committed handoffs `docs/handoffs/assistant-web.md` and `storefront-transition.md` | Repinned to the committed revision (artifacts byte-identical). Aligned with the handoff: answer text is never auto-linked; only `contact_data_redacted` shows a notice. Kept deliberately: key reuse once after an interruption (API replay semantics), "Cómo comprar" label. Live suite re-run against `dc4e4c6`: 6/6. The storefront transition confirms **no storefront chat work ever existed**, so there was nothing to hand over. |
| `pequeverso` | `develop` `7ae5987` | unchanged | — |
| `portfolio-assistant-web` | `develop` `aed8ea7`, clean tree | embed work and reviewed dependency updates committed | No change needed; this repository's protocol remains independent (no shared package). |
| `vps-ops` | `develop` `04be619` | dependency-review documentation | No Pequeverso web allocation yet; the deployment contract stands. |

Branch protection was aligned with `pequeverso-assistant-api` (`73d1f3b`, "simplify branch
protection to match the portfolio"): rulesets require pull requests and strict Required checks, block
force-pushes and deletion, and have no bypass; the branch flow and the owner-authorized hotfix rule
are a documented working agreement instead of a Branch policy check (removed to avoid friction,
after it had been verified live).

## Historical requests to other owners (2026-09-27)

These requests describe the former public chat shells. They are superseded by the backoffice
milestone below and the current [deployment contract](deployment-contract.md); they are not
activation instructions.

- **API agent:** (done: contract committed.) Web revision verified together: this repository's
  `develop` after the handoff-alignment PR, against API `dc4e4c6`. Open points: a retry of a failed
  run stores the question twice (visible after reload) — consider an explicit retry semantic; keep
  the idle heartbeat ≤ 15 s (the client treats 45 s of silence as a dead stream).
- **Storefront owner (deferred integration):** see `embed-integration.md` (removed; see git history) —
  `frame-src` addition, launcher/panel port of `tests/fixtures/host/host.ts`, page context values.
- **vps-ops:** see [deployment-contract.md](deployment-contract.md) — domain approval, Pequeverso
  renderer without the `frame-ancestors 'none'` override for the web service.
- **Portfolio web (FYI):** its `scripts/check-boundaries.ts` imports the TypeScript JS API, which
  TypeScript 7 no longer ships; an import scanner (as here) avoids that dependency.

## Backoffice milestone (2026-10-05)

| Repository | Revision | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `pequeverso-assistant-api` | `develop` `87fc109` (ops contract 1.2; earlier pins `b098d6f`, `07405d2`) | `contracts/ops/` pinned with `git show`; dashboard verified against a `git archive` of `332d3c7` and `87fc109` running the fixture provider |
| `portfolio-assistant-backoffice` (local clone `portfolio-assistant-web`) | `develop` `f29b6cd`, read with `git show` only | Quality reference for the backoffice. No code or identity copied |

Adopted from the portfolio reference (adapted, own code): 48 h invitations; audit by actor id,
action, subject id and time (no e-mails); owner re-check inside each mutation's transaction;
verified e-mail required on every protected request with cookie cache disabled; database-backed
rate limits; Better Auth logger disabled with app-level redacted events; cross-subdomain cookies
explicitly off; explicit linking only from an authenticated owner (enforced server-side);
readiness-gated sign-in with a safe "unavailable" surface and `/readyz`; native modal confirmation
with Escape and focus restore; copy feedback bound to the current invitation link; fixture-safety
guards (loopback origin, issuer and database with a test/fixture name; refusal without echoing
URLs) and their tests; OAuth state-rejection and CSRF integration tests; pg pool error handling.

Kept different on purpose: committed SQL for Better Auth's schema plus `npm run db:check`
(reviewable diffs; the reference applies the library's plan at deploy time); browser tests sign
in through a fake OAuth provider instead of minting sessions; role on the user row and removal by
deleting the account (the reference keeps a member table with `revoked_at`); Spanish-only UI.

## Repository rename (2026-10-05)

Renamed `pequeverso-assistant-web` → `pequeverso-assistant-backoffice` with GitHub's rename
(history, PRs, rulesets, visibility and license preserved; the old URL redirects). Done after the
public chat moved to the storefront (`pequeverso#69`) and its shells were removed (#23). Earlier
entries above keep the old name as historical record. vps-ops still references the old name in
its inventory; the redirect keeps it working and its owner updates it (handoff in the API's
`docs/handoffs/vps-ops.md`).


## 2026-10-12 — private operational contracts

Both private contract source records name API `develop` commit
`b7dcb0c27d214cb1b560a8ee6101f858545646fc`, integrated through API PR39. The summary1.2
schema/example bytes are unchanged from the historical `87fc109` pin; telemetry1.0 bytes
are unchanged from `03898d8` and the accessible interim `debb678` pin. The consumer verified
all four recorded SHA-256 hashes using that immutable producer commit. Public chat revision1.4
is independently additive and does not change either private schema or its bearer policy.

The dashboard reads private aggregate data and optional process observations; it performs no
model requests. Local browser timeout failures and final-image acceptance remain documented
in [verification](verification.md). No deployment, publication or assistant activation is
implied by this repin.


## Project backoffice repository identity — 2026-10-17

The owner authorized the GitHub rename `pequeverso-assistant-backoffice` →
`pequeverso-backoffice`. The repository ID, visibility, branch tips, rulesets and workflow IDs
were checked before and after the rename. The shared Git origin now uses the canonical URL;
physical checkout/worktree directories were deliberately not moved. Historical names, release
links and dated evidence remain history and use GitHub redirects.

Current package identity, OCI source labels, local CI/smoke image tags, skill descriptions and
dependency-policy fixtures follow the new repository name. No database, volume, cookie,
authentication identifier, environment name, contract or telemetry service identity changes.
Confirmed functionality remains access management and assistant operations/telemetry.
Project-wide analytics/events/funnels require separately authorized sources and contracts;
no extra data collection, automatic training or fabricated dashboard was added.

A real Mermaid parser check found the README sequence message with an unescaped semicolon
invalid. Replacing that punctuation with a comma preserves its meaning and restores parsing;
no architecture or runtime behavior changes.


## Paired agent discovery (2026-10-18)

Inspected the portfolio backoffice's committed
`a124139e1cfa1d0d496fcf76c518830491fc1679` source with `git show`; its working tree was
not edited. Adopted the canonical `.claude/skills` catalog and relative directory symlinks
from `.agents/skills`. The three existing Pequeverso web procedures, names, descriptions
and limits retain their own content. The stdlib-only validator and filesystem negative
tests follow this repository's Node/TypeScript toolchain without adding dependencies.
See [agent skills](agent-skills.md) and the [architecture map](architecture.md#paired-repository-conventions).
