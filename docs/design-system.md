# Design system

The backoffice belongs to Pequeverso, so it uses the store's identity — cream paper, navy ink,
teal accents, Fraunces for headings, Nunito Sans for reading — tuned for dense operational
reading. Coral stays reserved for commerce and is not used here (status uses teal, navy and gold). The portfolio assistant shares engineering principles with
this repository, not its visual identity.

**Single source of truth:** `src/app/globals.css`. Components use semantic Tailwind utilities
(`bg-surface`, `text-ink`, `text-copy`, …) and never raw brand values or hex codes.

## Layers

1. **Raw brand values** `--pv-*` — copied from the storefront (`pequeverso` develop `7ae5987`,
   `src/app/globals.css`), including its contrast measurements.
2. **Semantic roles** — defined for `light` (default, the storefront's only theme) and `dark` (the
   storefront's night-sky bands extended into a full reading theme).
3. **Tailwind theme** — `@theme inline` maps roles to utilities.

Theme mechanism: `<html data-theme="light|dark">`, set before first paint (`layout.tsx`, nonce
script) from the system preference. There is no in-app toggle. Both themes are covered by the
browser suite (axe and screenshots).

## Colour roles

| Role (utility) | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `surface` | cream `#fffaf2` | navy night | Page and dashboard ground |
| `surface-raised` | white | raised navy | Cards, access forms, disclosures |
| `surface-sunken` | sky `#e8f3ff` | sunken navy | Wells, table headers, image placeholders |
| `surface-user` / `on-user` | navy / white | turquoise / ink | Retained storefront token; unused by the backoffice |
| `ink` | `#0b1f3a` | white | Headings, strong text |
| `copy` | `#425267` (7.7:1 on cream) | white 86 % | Reading text |
| `muted` | `#5d6b80` (5.2:1 on cream) | white 68 % | Notes, hints |
| `action` / `on-action` | navy / white | turquoise / ink | Sign-in, invitations, primary operations actions |
| `purchase` / `on-purchase` | coral `#c64035` / white (5.0:1) | same | Retained commerce token; unused by the backoffice |
| `amount` | coral | soft coral | Retained commerce token; unused by the backoffice |
| `link` | teal text `#005e5b` | turquoise | Inline links |
| `icon` | teal `#007d79` | turquoise | Decorative icons |
| `chip` / `on-chip` | mint / navy | white 9 % / white | Role and status badges |
| `notice` / `danger-surface` / `danger` | lemon; rose / coral-hover | tinted | Notices; failures |
| `line`, `line-strong` | navy 14 % / 28 % | white 12 % / 26 % | Borders |
| `ring` | navy | turquoise | Focus outline (3 px, offset 2 px) |

Automated axe scans pass on the backoffice pages in both themes ([verification.md](verification.md));
that is not a full contrast audit of every state. Chart series use `--chart-*` roles (never coral).

## Typography

| Utility | Size / line height | Family and weight | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text-display` | 26→36 px / 1.1 | Fraunces 700 | Reserved (not used in the panel) |
| `text-heading` | 22 px / 1.2 | Fraunces 700 | Page headings |
| `text-title` | 17 px / 1.3 | Fraunces 700 | Section titles |
| `text-price` | 22 px / 1.1 | Fraunces 700, `amount` colour | Retained storefront size; unused by the backoffice |
| `text-body` | 16 px / 1.6 | Nunito Sans 500 | Reading text and inputs (16 px avoids iOS zoom on focus) |
| `text-small` | 14 px / 1.5 | Nunito Sans | Buttons, summaries |
| `text-tiny` | 13 px / 1.45 | Nunito Sans | Labels (uppercase + tracking for section labels), hints |

Fonts are self-hosted variable woff2 (OFL) with metric-matched fallbacks and preloaded; there is no
request to Google Fonts. Reading width is capped at `max-w-measure` (42 rem).

**Naming rule:** font-size and colour token names must never collide (`text-body` is a size, the
reading colour is `text-copy`; `text-price` is a size, the price colour is `text-amount`), and every
custom size is registered in `src/shared/ui/cn.ts` so `tailwind-merge` does not drop colours.

## Spacing, radius, elevation, icons

- Spacing: Tailwind's 4 px scale. Dashboard sections use 24 px gaps; page gutters are 16 px (24 px from `sm`).
- Radius: `sm` 4, `chip` 6, `md` 12 (callouts, disclosures, tables), `lg` 20 (cards),
  `xl` 28 (retained storefront token), `pill` (every button and chip, as on the storefront).
- Elevation: navy-tinted `shadow-sm` (cards) and `shadow-md` (dialogs); commerce elevation tokens
  are retained and unused.
- Icons: lucide, 20 px in buttons (`[&_svg]:size-5`), 16 px in small buttons and inline labels,
  14 px next to link text; always `aria-hidden`, never the only label.
- Touch targets: ≥ 44 px (`sm` buttons are 44 px tall; header icon buttons 44 px).

## Components (`src/shared/ui`, owned shadcn-style primitives)

| Component | Variants | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Button` / `LinkButton` | `action`, `outline`, `ghost`, `chip`, `link` (+ `purchase`, unused here) × `sm`, `md`, `icon`, `icon-sm` | CVA; links stay `<a>` |
| `Badge` | `chip`, `quiet`, `notice` | Catalog status, freshness |
| `Callout` | `info`, `notice`, `danger` | Status messages; caller chooses `role` |
| `Section`, `Facts`, `TableRegion` | — | Labelled dashboard regions, term/value lists that show "No disponible", keyboard-scrollable tables |
| `BrandMark` | sizes 24/32/40/56 | Isotipo |

Feature components: `Dashboard` (server component; availability, service, catalog, budget with a
native `<meter>`, runs per window, daily table and Recharts trend from two days, recent runs),
`DailyCharts` (client; no animation; SVG hidden from assistive technology because the table carries
the data), `SignInPanel` (buttons disabled until hydrated), `InviteForm` (one-time link with copy
feedback bound to that link), `ConfirmAction` (native modal `<dialog>`: Escape cancels, focus
returns to the trigger or, after success, to the section heading).

## Motion

Only state changes animate (150 ms colour/opacity transitions); charts render without animation.
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` collapses all durations.

## Layout rules

- Content max width 72rem with 16px gutters (24 px from `sm`). Four current summary indicators lead the dashboard; daily analytics share a desktop grid with budget/catalog, while technical diagnostics use a native disclosure. Explicit zero-minimum base tracks keep enlarged text readable; wide tables scroll in their existing keyboard-focusable regions.
- Header: brand/account/navigation share rows when space permits and wrap naturally with enlarged text. Long words in facts and native summaries can wrap; no content is hidden to mask page overflow.
- Long values (e-mails, revisions, ids) wrap (`overflow-wrap: anywhere`); wide tables scroll
  horizontally inside a focusable region.
- Touch targets ≥ 44 px.

## Copy lint

UI copy uses neutral Latin American Spanish with "tú". `quality/copy/voseo-denylist.json`
contains whole-word voseo forms and regionalisms, matched case-insensitively with Unicode
accents. The scanner checks string literals, template segments and JSX text in `src/**/*.ts`
and `src/**/*.tsx`, excluding tests, comments and module specifiers. All literals are
conservative copy candidates; this scaffolding does not infer whether a string is Spanish.

`quality/copy/voseo-baseline.json` records existing matches by file and word with counts,
so line changes do not churn it. Even context-dependent words such as "dale" and "plata"
go through this baseline. New matches fail; stale entries or counts also fail. The baseline
only shrinks during normal maintenance.

- Run `npm run copy:check` (or `node scripts/copy-lint.ts`); the full `npm run check` includes it.
- After removing matches, run `node scripts/copy-lint.ts --write-baseline` to remove entries
  or lower counts. It refuses additions to an existing baseline.
- The same command creates an absent baseline. Explicit initialization or reinitialization
  with additions requires `node scripts/copy-lint.ts --write-baseline --init`; review those
  changes carefully.
